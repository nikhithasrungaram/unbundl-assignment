# 🚀 Responsive Landing Page — Frontend Assignment (Unbundl)

This repository contains my submission for the **Unbundl Frontend Developer Assignment**. The task required converting a given Figma design into a responsive, interactive landing page using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** — without using any external UI frameworks or libraries.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate design-to-code accuracy, clean code structure, mobile responsiveness, and deployment readiness.
